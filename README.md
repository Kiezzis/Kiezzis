Hello hello!!! I'm kiez/Viz!
I'm genderfluid so uhh I allow you to use any pronounce except "it" ,, no hate to people who use that pronounce btw,! <3

----------------------------**---------------------------`,

I would AFK a lot, like,, really a lot. I often go online just to AFK or show that I'm still alive. /sarcasm. ALWAYSSSS whisper to interact with me when I seem to be AFK. I prefered to be alone 24/7 but I don't mind mutuals/friends (idk the difference of those two lolol) cuddles with me while I'm AFK. Just because I'm offline a lot, doesn't mean I won't come back btw!!! If you're a close friend of mine, I will try to find a way to tell you if I lost my account, or whatever happened. If I can't, then I'm so sorry, dear friend.
`` I can be very dry sometimes. Maybe I'm not in the mood, or maybe just feel mentally drained. When I'm upset, it's best to leave me alone. English is not my first language, so please don't overeact, make fun of me, or anrgy at me for using the wrong words in my sentence. Sometimes I say offensive sentense without even realizing or meaning it.
